Recently, I got reminded of how much I regularly benefit from having learnt and played chess for so many years, and
still being active as a hobbyist. It has had n-th order consequences that I could never have predicted as a 14yo just
playing to beat everyone. Most importantly, the connections I've made over the years and the experiences I've had are
priceless.

To take some concrete examples,
1. I met people at the [Bangalore Chess Club](https://www.chessbase.in/news/Bangalore-Chess-Club-A-free-to-play-open-to-all-OTB-chess-club)
whom I immediately got along with extremely well. All of the friends I met there have chosen work that I too would find
very interesting. It's incredible to me that I can find such a concentration of interesting folks out of pure
coincidence.
2. Due to this crowd, I had 2 crazy nights during my visit to the Chennai Olympiad. There I met and played with
people from countries apart, some who didn't even speak English. And yet we played, shared our Lichess IDs and had
fun.
3. After one meetup in Bangalore, 3 of us attendees decided to have lunch together and coincidentally ran into a 4th
at the restaurant - all of us knowing each other only as "i saw him/her earlier today" - and we played hand & brain
chess at the restaurant. Where else could that have happened, and if that wasn't bonkers enough, we then spent hours
together going to different places in the city.
4. I starting going to the gym now, and met multiple of my old friends whom I've known for years and literally spent
days with (like when travelling for tournaments). Now they are my workout buddies.

I value experiences and friends very highly because to me it's a life well-lived if I can point to A, B, C as moments
where I had the kind of fun that is memorable in a certain way.

Other than the connections, my liking for blindfold chess pushed me to build
[my first non-trivial software project](https://github.com/nikochiko/df-wizard-chess). If I didn't have that motivation,
I probably might have given up or only done something like this at a much later stage (or, god forbid, "not have a
project idea").

It has brought me a lot of satisfaction at random moments in life, and even in my tech life. I think this
likely extends to most other hobbies, and it can be extremely rewarding - both professionally and personally - to be a
passionate hobbyist.
