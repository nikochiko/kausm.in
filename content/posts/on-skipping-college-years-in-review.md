It has been about two and a half years since I completed high school, and one and a half since I made the decision to skip college.
It feels like a good time to review my years, and give a completely honest picture of what it's like. Hopefully through that, I'll be
able to address my own doubts about my decision.

I'm happy right now with where I am. On most days, I spend most of the time on work and/or studying from a book or an online course.
My work is interesting. I get good mentorship and I have visibly improved. Not just in terms of technical skill but also work ethic
and the process before implementation. I get to take time off from work to spend on studies and I often do that.
One of my ongoing goals is to study in full the computer science courses that are taught in an undergraduate program. That excites me
and I've liked it a lot. Every new thing learnt feels like a new toy that I can play with. I also study some other things, such as
functional programming. I'm learning new things about notation and programming that I hadn't known before.
It has had a definitely visible effect on how I think about and write programs.
It's also just simply super cool for the features it has (infinite sequences, combinators, pattern matching). I feel like I'm learning
a lot. I had feared that I'd get out of touch with math and avoid it. To my own surprise, it has been the opposite. I don't feel scared
of math, and in fact I'm more in touch with math than before. I like it. What I don't know though, and cannot know, is if it would have
been any different had I gone to a college. Would I have been better off or worse, or does it not matter at all?

I think about it often. I had an almost perfect SAT score, and even though my academics were shaky, I had proven in my drop year(s)
that I was smart enough to get real work done. I thought of applying, even took the English language test, but somehow I never felt
motivated enough to power through the terribly tedious application process. Even for colleges within India, I had the plans and
opportunities but somehow it always felt wrong when it came time to make the final call.

Some days ago I pointed out to my friends that I had suddenly gotten "nerdier" in the past few months. I was surprising myself
with how excited I was about "nerdy" things. I would only be only waiting for the opportunity to tell my friends about "this cool
language where your function definitions are shorter than their names", or "this one innocent-looking recursive function that could
perform multiplication, exponentation, exponentation of exponentation, and so on, only by incrementing one of the arguments". This
one time while I was helping a friend with her theoretical CS course, I read about state machines and got so excited about implementing
a regex compiler that I built some of that mid-travel in a car. That got me thinking if I would have been so excited about it had I
been taught that in a college. I started discussing this with some friends, wondering if I'd be as excited had I gone to a college
instead, when one of them asked me if I was excited about school. That's when I remembered how uninteresting
school was for me. I hated classrooms because I'd get bored by the end of the day and return home sleepy. I hated social studies in
school but now I voluntarily read about economics, geography, or media because it I take an active interest in it. I always
looked forward to holidays because that's when I would be the most productive in doing things that I liked.

I think that between all the arguments that I had to defend my decision against with pragmatic answers about the options I
had in the future, I had forgotten my initial motivation to some extent. I'm sure that I would resist being taught in a
classroom. I don't know if it would be any different at this institution or that, but I doubt I'd enjoy the college environment
more than school. I wouldn't suggest anyone to skip college either just to prove that the system is broken. It may be so, but that
reason is not good enough. It's a decision that comes with personal risk, so the motivation should also be personal (selfish). There
are trade-offs and making it to a good college does pay with the opportunities. I think that I have been lucky, and privileged in
more than one ways to feel positively about my position at this point.
