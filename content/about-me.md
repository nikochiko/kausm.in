I contribute to and build FOSS for fun, and ocassionally write about programming.
My current interest is in the design and implementation of programming languages.

I have a broad skill set that is still expanding. I have good experience in web development,
infra, Python, Linux, and machine learning. I am currently learning more about programming
languages, compilers and interpreters, and Haskell.

I'll add more about me at some point ...

Interests: <a>Python, Haskell, Programming Languages, Functional Programming, Machine Learning, self-hosting</a>
